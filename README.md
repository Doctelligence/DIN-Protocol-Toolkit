# DIN-Protocol-Toolkit üöÄ

Welcome to the **DIN-Protocol-Toolkit**! This toolkit is your gateway to deploying and managing smart contracts for the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) protocol. It includes everything you need to build, deploy, and interact with DIN smart contracts.

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- **src/**: Contains utility scripts and code related to federated learning and other functionalities.
  - `secure_aggregation.py`: Code for secure aggregation processes.
  - `model_utils.py`: Utilities for model operations.
  - `ipfs_utils.py`: Utilities for IPFS interactions.
  - `fl_client.py`: Client for interacting with federated learning components.
  - `crypto_utils.py`: Cryptographic utilities.

- **script/**: Includes the deployment script for the smart contracts.
  - `deploy_din_protocol.js`: Deploys all DIN protocol related contracts.

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts used in the DIN protocol.
  - `StakeNFT.sol`: Contract for staking NFTs.
  - `RewardDistribution.sol`: Handles reward distribution logic.
  - `IntelligenceProtocol.sol`: Core protocol contract.
  - `HarbergerAuction.sol`: Implements Harberger auction mechanism.
  - `EvaluatorRegistry.sol`: Manages evaluator registrations.
  - `ERC721-Stake.sol`: ERC721 token with staking functionality.
  - `DINProtocol.sol`: Main DIN protocol contract.
  - `AggregatorManagement.sol`: Manages aggregators within the network.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the DIN-Protocol-Toolkit, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Hardhat**: Install Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum, using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat

## Installation
Clone the repository:
     ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-organization/DIN-Protocol-Toolkit.git
  cd DIN-Protocol-Toolkit

Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
  npm install

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts, run the deployment script with Hardhat:
    ```bash
  npx hardhat run script/deploy_din_protocol.js --network <network_name>
  Replace <network_name> with the name of the network you are deploying to (e.g., localhost, ropsten, mainnet, etc.).

## Usage
Interacting with Contracts: Use the provided Python scripts in the src/ directory to interact with deployed contracts and perform federated learning operations.
Updating Contracts: Modify the Solidity files in the contracts/ directory to update or add new functionality. Be sure to redeploy the contracts after making changes.
